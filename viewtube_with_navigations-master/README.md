# ViewTube

## Introduction

OTT – Over-the-top media is no longer the future of entertainment but is now the reality.​

With over 50% of North Americans maintaining Netflix subscriptions, it is clear that consumers love OTT content. It is the most popular form of entertainment today across all age groups. All that a consumer needs to have is a compatible hardware device enabled with a good internet connection.​

An “over-the-top” media service is any online content provider that offers streaming media as a standalone product. An OTT conversation largely revolves around video-on-demand. However, it also supports audio, messaging, and VOIP.​

Any application or service that provides a product over the internet while bypassing traditional media services is an OTT application.​

Popular OTT applications for video streaming are Netflix, Amazon Video, YouTube, HBO, etc.

## Enhancements

Seeing the demand of OTT applications, the team at Ezone Pvt. Ltd., which is popular in providing software solutions in the field of entertainment, has started with a project to develop an OTT application – ViewTube. ​

OTT application, is designed for two types of users: ​

1. One set of users are all keen on viewing the videos over this OTT platform. ​

2. The second set of users are interested in creating and publishing their own videos or even schedule live events over this OTT platform. ​

Hence the team at Ezone wants to make it navigable and integrate with all the views currently designed and allowing users to navigate to the chosen view.​

## Problem Statement

In the first phase, to stay ahead in the heavily competitive market, the Ezone Pvt. Ltd. wants to release the ViewTube application quickly to market with all the views currently designed and allowing users to navigate to the chosen view.​

Following views are designed and needs to be integrated with application​

1. Landing View :: Providing list of videos to users​

2. Studio Upload Video View :: Allowing users to upload video​

3. Watch Video View :: Allowing users to watch videos​

Application should load with Landing view, where user can see available videos to watch, if user clicks on any video it should navigate to watch video view and user should be able to watch video.​

Application should provide studio view, where user can go and upload videos.​

## Instructions

1. Download and unzip the boilerplate code.  
2. Run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies.  
3. Open the boilerplate code in VSCode to develop the assignment solution.
4. The solution code for components and views related to Studio can be taken from the previous week's practice assignment solution.  
4. The boilerplate consists of partially written codes for `Home`,`UploadVideo`, `VideoDetailsPreview`, `WatchVideo` and `PageNotFound` views and components. The code has to be completed to make the app functional.
5. The boilerplate also contains the `videocolln.json` file located within the assets folder that contains the details for each video clip displayed on the app.
6. The route configuration code should be added to `AppRouter.js` file.
7. The `ApplicationBar` and `SideDrawer` components should be provided with navigation links to navigate to `Home` and `Studio` views.
8. Each video clip image when clicked should navigate the user to `Watch` view.
9. First, test the solution locally by running the command `npm run test`.  
10. Refactor the solution to ensure all test cases are passing.  
11. DO NOT MODIFY THE PROVIDED SOLUTION CODE, ELSE THIS MAY IMPACT THE TEST CODE EXECUTION.
12. Zip the solution code **without node_modules folder** with the name same as the assignment name.
13. Upload the zipped solution for submission.
